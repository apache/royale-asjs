Google Closure Compiler bundles a subset of JSR 305 under the BSD License.  
For details see: https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/blob/master/README.md.  The
README.md is confusing as clicking the link takes you to a project that is LGPL, but
that project is distributing the original JSR 305 artifact that is BSD.  See:
https://github.com/findbugsproject/findbugs/blob/3.0.1/findbugs/licenses/LICENSE-jsr305.txt.  In JSR 305, the GuardedBy.class appears to be CC-BY-2.5.
