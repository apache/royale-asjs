DESCRIPTION

The DataBindingTestbed shows a Royale application that is simply a test application
for a range of Databinding variations. Its primary purpose is to demonstrate to the
development team examples of bindings that do not currently work or do not work well,
as well as what currently works, and therefore serves to demonstrate what areas
require attention for improvements or bugfixes.

This Royale application may be run as a Flash SWF or cross-compiled (using the Royale Compiler)
into JavaScript and HTML and run without Flash.

The DataBindingTestbed is primarily for development purposes, but also shows 
simple examples of a range of binding types that might be useful as examples for
Royale developers to see how things work (or what currently does not work).
The examples in the code that are commented out are very likely things that need
attention or fixes. If you encounter any bugs in binding that are not currently
represented in this example, please contact the dev team via the mailing list

NOTES

The cross-compilation to JavaScript often results in non-fatal warnings. Some of these warnings
should be addressed in future releases of the the Royale Compiler compiler.
