DESCRIPTION

The RoyaleTest_SVG example shows how to use SVG to skin components when run in
the HTML/JavaScript environment.

This Royale application may be run as a Flash SWF or cross-compiled (using the Royale Compiler)
into JavaScript and HTML and run without Flash.

The RoyaleTest_SVG application may be run in ActionScript, which uses standard Flash
drawing to produce the button skin. When run in JavaScript however, SVG is used to
make the skin.

To make the skin, a new classification of TextButton was created in the 
org.apache.royale.svg package. On the ActionScript side, the svg.TextButton simply
extends the normal TextButton. On the JavaScript side, the svg.TextButton class
uses an SVG file (svg.assets.TextButton_skin.svg).

COMPONENTS and BEADS

- Label
- TextButton

NOTES

Maybe a more standard or common way or place to specify skins could be developed so
specialized packages would not always be needed.
