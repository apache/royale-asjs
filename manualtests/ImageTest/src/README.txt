DESCRIPTION

The ImageTest example is a simple demonstration of the Royale Image component.
You can use this test to see if your image loads properly. 

This Royale application may be run as a Flash SWF or cross-compiled (using the Royale Compiler)
into JavaScript and HTML and run without Flash.

All of the images are placed into a Container and then given various sizes.

COMPONENTS and BEADS

- Container
- Image

- NonVirtualVerticalLayout

NOTES

The cross-compilation to JavaScript often results in non-fatal warnings. Some of these warnings
should be addressed in future releases of the the Royale Compiler compiler.
