DESCRIPTION

The ListsTests example demonstrates the Royale List component using custom data
and a custom itemRenderer. 

This Royale application may be run as a Flash SWF or cross-compiled (using the Royale Compiler)
into JavaScript and HTML and run without Flash.

The data for the list is found in the application model and is bound to the list
via ConstantBinding bead which maps the application data model's products property
to the List's dataProvider property.

The display of each element of the list is through a custom itemRenderer, 
ProductItemRenderer, which can found in the example's source tree. The itemRenderer
uses and Image component to display an image and a Label to give a title.

COMPONENTS and BEADS

- Image
- Label
- List

- ConstantBinding

NOTES

More control of the itemRenderer via styles would be a nice addition. ItemRenderers
based on row or data would require a custom itemRendererFactory bead.
