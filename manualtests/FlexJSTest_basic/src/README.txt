DESCRIPTION

The FlexJSTest_basic demonstrates a number of the common components in the FlexJS
SDK (listed below).

This Flex application may be run either as an ActionScript SWF or cross-compiled
into JavsScript/HTML using the Falcon JX compiler and run without using the
Flash Player.

This application also uses the same financial data as the DataBindingTest,
accessed using HTTPService, although it uses the ConstantBinding bead to
display the remote data instead of data binding.

COMPONENTS and BEADS

- CheckBox
- ComboBox
- DropDownList
- Label
- List
- RadioButton
- TextArea
- TextButton

NOTES

In ActionScript, the hit area for radio and check boxes is limited to the
radio or check itself and not the label.
