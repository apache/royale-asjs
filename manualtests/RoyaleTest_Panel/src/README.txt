DESCRIPTION

The RoyaleTest_Panel application demonstrates some Royale common components,
incuding Panel. The application uses a Panel to contain a sub-set of Royale
components, listed below.

This Royale application may be run as a Flash SWF or cross-compiled (using the Royale Compiler)
into JavaScript and HTML and run without Flash.

COMPONENTS and BEADS

- Label
- NumericStepper
- Panel
- Slider
- TextButton

- NonVirtualVerticalLayout

NOTES

Changing the Slider updates a Label. Changing the NumericStepper changes another Label.

The ActionScript version has some layout issues, chiefly the Panel background is not being
displayed. The JavaScript version is not updating the Labels when either the Slider or
NumericStepper is changed.
