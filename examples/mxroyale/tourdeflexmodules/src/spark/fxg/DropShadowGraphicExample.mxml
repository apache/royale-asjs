objects. The shadow algorithm is based on the same box filter that the blur filter uses. You have 
several options for the style of the drop shadow, including inner or outer shadow and knockout mode. 
You can apply the filter to any display object (that is, objects that inherit from the DisplayObject 
class), such as MovieClip, SimpleButton, TextField, and Video objects, as well as to BitmapData objects."/>
