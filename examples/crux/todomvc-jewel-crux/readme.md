## Running

The app is built upon [AS3](https://apache.github.io/royale-docs/features/as3) and [MXML](https://apache.github.io/royale-docs/features/mxml) languages and compiled with the Apache Royale Compiler.
We use [Maven](https://maven.apache.org) and [ANT](https://ant.apache.org) to build the project.
