DESCRIPTION

The DateControlsExample demonstrates the DateChooser and DateField components. The
DataChooser displays a calendar in place while the DateField displays a calendar
in a pop-up.

This Royale application may be run as a Flash SWF or cross-compiled (using the Royale Compiler)
into JavaScript and HTML and run without Flash.

Selecting a date from the DateChooser sets the date in the DateField.

COMPONENTS and BEADS

- DateChooser
- DateField
- Label

NOTES

In the ActionScript/SWF version, each button/date in the DateChooser has a hit area
that's smaller than the button itself.

In the ActionScript/SWF version, the last-selected date in the DateField pop-up
calendar may remain selected.
