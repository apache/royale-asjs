Apache Royale 0.9.0
===================

Apache Royale is an SDK that provides the capability to cross-compile MXML 
and ActionScript applications to HTML/JS/CSS so they can run in a browser
without Flash.

Apache Royale was previously released by the Apache Flex project.  You can
see RELEASE_NOTES for earlier releases in the Apache Flex releases.

This RELEASE_NOTES file is used for the top-level source and binary package.  The
individual folders (royale-compiler, royale-typedefs, royale-asjs) each have their own
RELEASE_NOTES file specific to the contents of those folders.
