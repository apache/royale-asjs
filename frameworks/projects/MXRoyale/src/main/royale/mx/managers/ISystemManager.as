/**
 *  An ISystemManager manages an "application window".
 *  Every application that runs on the desktop or in a browser
 *  has an area where the visuals of the application will be
 *  displayed.  It may be a window in the operating system
 *  or an area within the browser.  That is an "application window"
 *  and different from an instance of <code>mx.core.Application</code>, which
 *  is the main "top-level" window within an application.
 *
 *  <p>Every application has an ISystemManager.  
 *  The ISystemManager  sends an event if
 *  the size of the application window changes (you cannot change it from
 *  within the application, but only through interaction with the operating
 *  system window or browser).  It parents all displayable items within the
 *  application, such as the main mx.core.Application instance and all popups, 
 *  tooltips, cursors, an so on.  Any object parented by the ISystemManager is
 *  considered to be a "top-level" window, even tooltips and cursors.</p>
 *
 *  <p>The ISystemManager also switches focus between top-level windows
 *  if there  are more than one IFocusManagerContainer displayed and users
 *  are interacting with components within the IFocusManagerContainers.</p>
 *
 *  <p>All keyboard and mouse activity that is not expressly trapped is seen
 *  by the ISystemManager, making it a good place to monitor activity
 *  should you need to do so.</p>
 *
 *  <p>If an application is loaded into another application, an ISystemManager
 *  will still be created, but will not manage an "application window",
 *  depending on security and domain rules.
 *  Instead, it will be the <code>content</code> of the <code>Loader</code> 
 *  that loaded it and simply serve as the parent of the sub-application</p>
 *
 *  <p>The ISystemManager maintains multiple lists of children, one each for
 *  tooltips, cursors, popup windows.
 *  This is how it ensures that popup windows "float" above the main
 *  application windows and that tooltips "float" above that
 *  and cursors above that.
 *  If you examine the <code>numChildren</code> property 
 *  or <code>getChildAt()</code> method on the ISystemManager
 *  you are accessing the main application window and any other windows
 *  that aren't popped up.
 *  To get the list of all windows, including popups, tooltips and cursors,
 *  use the <code>rawChildren</code> property.</p>
